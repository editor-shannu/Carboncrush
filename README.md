CarbonCrush began as a spark—just an idea about making green commuting more than a once-a-year 
campaign. Over the course of my 1M1B internship, that spark turned into a living, breathing platform 
where sustainability isn’t a chore, it’s a challenge. I learned that change doesn’t always need to start with 
massive policies or complex systems—it can start with a single choice: walking instead of driving, 
carpooling with friends, or hopping on a bicycle. 
What truly surprised me was how much people love seeing their impact in real time. When students saw 
the CO₂ they were saving and their name climbing up the leaderboard, sustainability stopped being “good 
for the planet someday” and became “fun for me today.” 
This project taught me the magic formula—technology + gamification + community = real action. I 
now see code not just as logic and functions, but as a way to inspire behavior change and bring people 
together for a shared purpose. 
Most importantly, I’ve realized that small steps, when celebrated and repeated, can build unstoppable 
momentum. CarbonCrush isn’t just an app—it’s a movement, and this is only the beginning.
